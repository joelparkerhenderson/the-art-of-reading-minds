# The Art of Reading Minds

My notes for the book "The Art of Reading Minds" by Henrik Fexus.

## Rapport

Rapport can be better when you align with another person:

* body language

* posture

* breathing

* tempo

* energy level

* word choice


## Eye movements

Visual memory:

* How does your living room look?

* What color is your car?

* Describe how your best friend looks.

Visual construction:

* How would you look with long/short hair?

* Imagine painting your living room with stripes.

* How would you write your name upside-down?

Auditory memory:

* How does your favorite song start?

* Imagine the sound of your alarm clock going.

* Do you remember exactly what she said just before she left?

Auditory construction:

* Can you image Barack Obama on helium?

* What kinds of voices did Laurel and Hardy have?

* How would Taylor Swift sound underwater?

Kinesthetic memory:

* Do you remember how hot it was last summer?

* How does an old pair of used socks smell?

* Imagine eating a lemon.

Talking to yourself a.k.a. internal dialogue:

* Can you ask yourself if you often speak to yourself?

* What do you say when you're completely alone and something goes wrong?


## For meetings

Cover all four modalities:

* For auditory people: prepare your speech/lecture/phrases/etc.

* For visual people: use slides/posters/diagrams/etc.

* For kinesthetic people: use handouts/giveaways/notes/etc.

* For neutral people: use logical rational direct arguments.
